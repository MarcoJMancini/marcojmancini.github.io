# Building an Effective Open Source SOC: Tools and Best Practices

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving threat landscape, organizations of all sizes need robust security operations. However, building and maintaining a Security Operations Center (SOC) can be resource-intensive. This is where open-source tools come into play, offering powerful capabilities without the hefty price tag. In this post, we'll explore how to build an effective SOC using open-source tools, following the "Funnel of Fidelity" model.

## The Problem: Balancing Effectiveness and Cost in SOC Operations

Many organizations face a common challenge: how to establish a SOC that's both effective and cost-efficient. Commercial solutions often come with significant expenses, while building from scratch can be time-consuming and complex. Open-source tools offer a middle ground, providing advanced capabilities with the flexibility to customize according to specific needs.

## The Funnel of Fidelity: A Framework for SOC Operations

The "Funnel of Fidelity" is a concept introduced by SpecterOps that helps visualize the SOC process. Let's break down each stage and explore the open-source tools that can support them:

### 1. Monitoring

At the top of the funnel, we cast a wide net to collect as much relevant data as possible.

**Tools:**
- **Elastic Stack (ELK)**: For log collection and initial analysis
- **Zeek (formerly Bro)**: For network security monitoring

### 2. Detection

Here, we apply detection rules and analytics to identify potential threats.

**Tools:**
- **Suricata**: An open-source intrusion detection system
- **Wazuh**: A comprehensive security monitoring solution

### 3. Triage

At this stage, we determine which alerts warrant further investigation.

**Tool:**
- **TheHive**: An open-source, scalable security incident response platform

### 4. Investigation

Now we dig deeper into the incidents that have been triaged for further analysis.

**Tools:**
- **TheHive**: Continues to play a role in managing the investigation process
- **Cortex**: An observable analysis and active response engine, often used in conjunction with TheHive
- **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)**: For threat intelligence management and sharing

### 5. Remediation

Finally, we take action to address the confirmed threats.

**Tool:**
- **WALKOFF**: An open-source automation framework that can be integrated with TheHive for automated response actions

## Proposed Architecture

Based on these tools, here's a high-level architecture for an open-source SOC:

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD
A[Log Sources] -->|Collects data| B[Elastic Stack]
B -->|Feeds data| C[Suricata/Wazuh]
C -->|Generates alerts| D[TheHive]
D -->|Sends observables| E[Cortex]
D -->|Shares threat intel| F[MISP]
D -->|Triggers actions| G[WALKOFF]
E -->|Returns analysis| D
F -->|Provides context| D
G -->|Executes remediation| D
</div>

This architecture allows for a streamlined workflow from initial log collection through to automated remediation actions.

## Considerations for Implementation

1. **Integration**: Ensure smooth integration between tools. For example, TheHive has built-in integrations with Cortex and MISP.
2. **Scalability**: Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for easier deployment and scaling.
3. **Community Support**: Leverage the active communities around these open-source tools for troubleshooting and updates.
4. **Customization**: Take advantage of the open-source nature to customize these tools to your specific needs.

## Metrics and KPIs

To measure the effectiveness of your SOC, consider tracking these key performance indicators:

1. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
2. Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
3. False Positive Rate
4. Incident Resolution Rate
5. Coverage of MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Conclusion

Building an effective SOC doesn't have to break the bank. By leveraging open-source tools and following the Funnel of Fidelity model, organizations can create a robust security operations capability that's both effective and cost-efficient. Remember, the key to success lies not just in the tools themselves, but in how well they're integrated, maintained, and aligned with your organization's specific security needs.
