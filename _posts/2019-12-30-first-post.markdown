Welcome to my new blog. I am Marco Mancini. The purpose of this blog is to organize my projects and thoughts on different topics.

My focus is Cybersecurity but I like to explore all kinds of topics, I will have some categories for philosophy, statics and may just curious facts and hypothesis about the world.

I don't have the ultimate truth and I am very happy to be proven wrong. Feel free to tell me if I am wrong, you can find my email in the about section.
And always doubt what people write on the internet.

Finally, I hope you find something interesting among my ramblings!
