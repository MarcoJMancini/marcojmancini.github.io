Welcome to my personal blog, I am Marco Mancini. My dayjob is to do Security engineering, with a flavour of incident response, Malware analysis and detection engineering.

While you are here you can check my master's thesis [Security Analytics with Elastic](http://openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/113266/6/mmanciniTFM1219memory.pdf)

If you want to ask me any questions, you can reach me on twitter :) (The link to my profile is at the bottom of the page).
